**Held by [[Tile]]s and manipulated by [[Structure]]s (and Weather in some other future)**

They describe the conditions of the [[Tile]] and the effects that will be considered during a Units occupations, movement, or attack of said Tile

All of the logic associated with the tags will be handled by the [[Tile]] itself

Examples: 
1) When an infantry Unit kills a naval Unit on the shoreline it could have increased attack due to standing on a cliff (high-ground = good), but be incapable of stepping on the shallow water tile since, well, it's a water tile
2) A tile provides a defense bonus when it's a forest, a fort is build on it or it has specific ruins 
3) A naval fort cannot be built on anything other than shorelines
