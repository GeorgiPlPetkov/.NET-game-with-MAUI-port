Concept:
	Polytopia with hexagonal tiles (not it's not Hexonia) and untrademarked tribe equivelants.  
Genres: 
	turnbased, grand-strategy, causal (until I'm done with it >:3), political-woke  
Goals:   
    1) create a library with all the game logic, it's what Niki would've wanted   
    2) make it a reskin of Polytopia since the base game is, well, quite basic 
    3) make an android port with MAUI since Monogame is uncooperative  
    4) turn it hoi5 once it's a passable project >:3  
  
Title Brainstorming: (casually stealing from Polytopia)  
1) Hexidyll - second best from the start baby, hex comes from hexagon and idyll is Latin for enjoyable place/period of time  
2) Hexelysium - got caught up in the synonym of utopia  
3) hExDEN - very cool, mixed casing, can also be read as "heden" and I love me some pointless edges - might sneak in some "organized religion bad" messaging if this ever goes beyond a pretty graph
4) hExLYSIUM - went back to elysium just in case, didn't like it more
